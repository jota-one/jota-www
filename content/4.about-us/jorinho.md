*Joriñho* sees the world like a big complex yet incredibly interesting thing to
modelize. He finds his pleasure in converting concepts into models and models
into programs.

The more complex the problem is, the more ideas he will suggest to solve it.
Most of them will probably be nuts, but one will always be good :muscle:

*You can ask him for:*
- Modeling (API, database, graphs, apps, Legos®, etc.)
- Backend engineering (microservices, REST API, HATEOAS, …)
- Frontend engineering (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, frameworks of all kinds)
- DevOps (build tools, CI/CD tools, unit/integration/e2e tests)
