#left
*Drosse* is a web server written in javascript that focuses on
mocking APIs in frontend projects.

#right
Unlike other similar tools that only serve static
content, Drosse can serve [dynamic content](https://drosse.dev#dynamic-mocks)
and ships with an internal [in-memory database](https://drosse.dev#data-persistence),
allowing developers to modify and persist data.
::

::block{title="RESTful in peace"}
Drosse has been built to be the *go to* web server for frontend development.
It's designed to meet every possible use case developers might encounter.

### :icon{name="airballoon" :size=32 color="var(--c-secondary)"} Lightweight
Drosse is as light as a nodejs process can be.
<small class="block opacity-50">
Install it as an `npm` dev dependency to your project or gloablly (or run it via docker...)
</small>

#right
### :icon{name="paperclip" :size=32 color="var(--c-secondary)"} Tight to your project
Your mocks come with you and so does the app that serves them.
<small class="block opacity-50">
You can launch your backend in the same `npm` command as your frontend app.
</small>
::

::block

#left
### :icon{name="graph" :size=32 color="var(--c-secondary)"} Cascading config
Route definitions and plugins (throttle, proxy, etc.) are written in a single
JSON file in a tree structure.
<small class="block opacity-50">
Inherit plugin configs from parent route, or overwrite them, it's that simple!
</small>

#right
### :icon{name="extension" :size=32 color="var(--c-secondary)"} Fully extensible
Need session management, jwt auth or consume a 3<sup>rd</sup> party API at runtime?
<small class="block opacity-50">
Drosse is compatible with express middlewares. Use its built-in ones or write your own(s)!
</small>
::

::block

#left
### :icon{name="database" :size=32 color="var(--c-secondary)"} Data persistence
Drosse ships with a fully integrated document database accessible through a super
easy-to-use API.
<small class="block opacity-50">
for advanced querying you can always use the built-in mongo-like syntax.
</small>

#right
### &nbsp;:nerd_face: &nbsp;Hackers compatible
Extensible REPL CLI, scraping mode, chainable proxying...
<small class="block opacity-50">
Wanna go hard on tweaking? Be our guest!

### Full microservice API simulation
> We needed to simulate a full microservice backend in javascript with
> mocked/anonymized data, including user login/session, helpdesk/3rd party
> system simulation so we built Drosse to manage all that...

### Testing a chat widget integration
> I had to mock a chat module backend to test its frontend widget tracking
> integration.
>
> Drosse let me do that in less than 5 minutes.

### Replace bloated mocking tool
> I mocked missing endpoints on top of an existing complex mock server.
> The new endpoints were done in no time with Drosse while the rest of the API
> fell back on the other mock server.
>
> Some weeks later, the bloated mocking solution was dropped in favor of
> Drosse... *:shrug:*

### Connect the dots
> I had this next.js app that I wanted to connect to my local sitecore backend
> API running on HTTPS with a self-signed certificate and could not figure out
> how to have next.js's proxy disable SSL checking.
>
> After 30 minutes of unsuccessful attempts, I `npm install`-ed drosse and got it
> working in split seconds...
>
> What else? *:coffee:*

### Trick CMS form validation
> I had to hook into Sitecore's *:rage:* jQuery form validation from my Vue.js app
> without any access to the Sitecore instance.
>
> I was about to throw myself through the window when I thought maybe Drosse
> could help me solve that issue.
>
> I copied the jQuery scripts into a static folder served by Drosse and added
> a route for the form submission (POST) and voilà!
> 
> Thank you Drosse's authors to make my life easier!

### E2E state management
> Drosse helped me bind my SPA to an e2e testing tool to reset state
> automatically (through custom user defined commands) before running my test
> scenarios and ensure the tests always run against the same backend state.
> 
> The goal here was to use only one set of mock for both local development and
> e2e testing.
>
> Goal achieved, huge gain of time, more time to spend with my daughter
(if I had one...) *:joy:*

### Data edition with moderation
> I wanted to mock the edition of person address data. But the changes must not
> applied directly ⏤ they are delayed for further control and validation.
>
> With Drosse and its built-in database, it’s possible to handle that.
> And it’s even possible, with the advanced CLI feature to create a script
> that will apply the person modifications by simply calling a custom command
> in the terminal.
>
> Drosse saved my entire life *:heart: :pray:*
